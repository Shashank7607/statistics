    "# Hypothesis Testing: Inferential statistics are used to test hypotheses and determine if there is enough evidence to support or reject a claim. For instance, a researcher might use hypothesis testing to determine if a new drug treatment is more effective than a standard treatment.\n",

    "# Confidence Intervals: These statistics provide a range of values within which a population parameter is likely to fall. For example, a confidence interval can be used to estimate the average income of a population based on a sample.\n",

    "# Regression Analysis: This statistical technique is used to model and analyze the relationship between variables. It can be employed to predict an outcome based on one or more predictor variables. For instance, regression analysis can be used to predict housing prices based on factors such as location, size, and amenities.\n",
